1) Write a program using concurrent APIs so that one thread can 
   produce some random integer data and other thread can read it

2) Write a program which will generate prime numbers in the range of
   1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400,401-500 and do the sum of prime 
   numbers and the collect the sum of all these variations and do  
   final total before displaying.
