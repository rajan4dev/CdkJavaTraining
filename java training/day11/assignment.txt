1) Write a program so that you can read 2 different files
   concurrently and print result on console.


2) Write a program using threads, one thread will increase the value 
   of valiable i and other thread will diaplay this value.
   
   Do this exercise using 2 workers and 2 tasks namely 
   ValueTask and PrintTask.
	
   And run the same program around 20 times and observe the result.

3) Write a program using java 5 concurrent  APIs to run tasks and it 
   is not known the size of tasks in advance so they may increase
   or decrease also in future, accordingly you have to pick right
   thread pool to use.
   
   Every task has to do the sum of 1-500 numbers and print.
