1) Design your calculator API to be distributed to other developers
   in such a way so that other developers can pass different 
   implementation of it in the form of lambdas.	

2) Collect some numbers in an array and design an API around it
   so that developers who will use your API should be able to
   do different manipulations on these numbers on the fly.
   Hint - use functional interface
   
3) Design a message sending API using functional programming approach
   introduced in Java 8. And design it to be flexible enough so that
   user/developers will supply the API behaviour according to thier 
   requirement i.e. (sms,email,whatsapp,jms) while sending message.
